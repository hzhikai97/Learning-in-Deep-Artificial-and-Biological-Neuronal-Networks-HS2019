\section{Disclaimer}
This document is intended to help the students of the 2019 lecture "Learning in Deep Artificial and Biological Neuronal Networks" by Professor Ben Grewe at ETHZ in reviewing the course and preparing for the exam. It does neither guarantee completeness nor correctness and it does not claim originality. The containing information is freely gathered and often copied word-by-word from the lecture materials and other from sources, such as books, papers, blog entries and Wikipedia. The document is a collaboration between many students. Ideally, all chapters have a responsible person each, who should be able to answer questions in case of ambiguities.
