\paragraph{Jeopardy}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{What is ADALINE?}
    See the appropriate section in the Learning Rules chapter.
    
    \item \textbf{What is the KL divergence?}
    An asymmetric measure of difference between two functions, often probability distributions, that does not obey the triangle inequality. $D_{KL}(P||Q) \geq 0$ is also known as the Gibbs' inequality.
    
    \item \textbf{What is the forward and backward methods in PyTorch?}
    Pytorch.autograd
    \item \textbf{What is fluorescence?}
    This signal can be detected when dopamine binds to dLight1.1
    \item \textbf{What is uncorrelated?}
    This is what $x1$ and $x2$ are, given $<x1,x2> - <x1><x2>$
    \item \textbf{What is the Hippocampus?} 
    Brain area for memory.
    \item \textbf{What is the NMDA receptor?}
    Responding to glutamate, this receptor opens for sodium and calcium ions.
    \item \textbf{What is symmetry?}
    This property is the reason why kl is not a real distance.
    \item \textbf{What is the prior matching term?}
    Besides data fitting, this term is also minimized in variational inference.
    \item \textbf{What is convolution?}
    In the superspike rule, this operation is used to generate eligibility traces.
    \item \textbf{What is two photon microscopy?}
    This method uses an infrared laser to image e.g. Ca2 activities.
    \item \textbf{What is independent component analysis (ICA)?}
    This unsupervised method enforces independence of its components.
    \item \textbf{What is VAE?}
    In this probabilistic autoencoder the latent representation of an input is sampled from a set of means and standard deviations
    \item \textbf{What is a Helmholtz Machine?}
    This network is trained via the Wake/sleep algorithm.
    \item \textbf{What are sodium and potassium ions?}
    The ions are responsible for generating an action potential.
    \item \textbf{What is the spike non-linearity?}
    This property of SNNs makes it difficult to train them.
    \item \textbf{What are amplitude an duration (resp what is shape)?}
    For consectutive action potentials these properties tend to stay constant.
    \item \textbf{What is a calcium ion?}
    CamK2 is dependent on this tiny second messenger.
    It is used to justify
    \item \textbf{What is the reparametrization trick?}
    deltaWij = xiyj is commonly use to formalize the simplest form
    \item \textbf{What is the hebbian learning rule?}
    \item \textbf{What is the temporal difference rule?}
    \item \textbf{What is the triplet rule?}
    In this rule a presynaptic, event followed by ps ev
    \item \textbf{What is facilitation/post tetanic potentiation?}
    In short-term plasticity this gain may precede depletion.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{More questions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{What are the differences between the weights of a deep network and the connections between biological neurons?} 
    In deep learning the weights are binary, if a neuron is activity it causes a change in the next layer.
    In biology if the action potential is modulated (axonal by myelinated and other factors) it will determine if the post neuron is activated, the dendritic epsp can be modulated before it reaches the axon hillock by summation and inhibition signals, the cell can in a refractory period or in excitability this means the effective connective between neurons can be modulated, also the inhibitory nts can modulate the epsp.
    \item \textbf{Is synaptic plasticity the only mechanism that neurons can use to alter their effective connectivity?}
    \item \textbf{Is weight tuning by BP the only mechanism in DNNs that affect the weights?}
    \item \textbf{What is the difference between BCM rule and triplet rule?}
