\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{What is ADALINE?}
    
    \item \textbf{What is the KL divergence?}
    
    \item \textbf{What is the forward and backward methods in PyTorch?}
    Pytorch.autograd
    \item \textbf{What is fluorescence?}
    This signal can be detected when dopamine binds to dLight1.1
    \item \textbf{What is uncorrelated?}
    This is what $x1$ and $x2$ are, given $<x1,x2> - <x1><x2>$
    \item \textbf{What is the Hippocampus?} 
    Brain area for memory.
    \item \textbf{What is the NMDA receptor?}
    Responding to glutamate, this receptor opens for sodium and calcium ions.
    \item \textbf{What is symmetry?}
    This property is the reason why kl is not a real distance.
    \item \textbf{What is the prior matching term?}
    Besides data fitting, this term is also minimized in variational inference.
    \item \textbf{What is convolution?}
    In the superspike rule, this operation is used to generate eligibility traces.
    \item \textbf{What is two photon microscopy?}
    This method uses an infrared laser to image e.g. Ca2 activities.
    \item \textbf{What is independent component analysis (ICA)?}
    This unsupervised method enforces independence of its components.
    \item \textbf{What is VAE?}
    In this probabilistic autoencoder the latent representation of an input is sampled from a set of means and standard deviations
    \item \textbf{What is a Helmholtz Machine?}
    This network is trained via the Wake/sleep algorithm.
    \item \textbf{What are sodium and potassium ions?}
    The ions are responsible for generating an action potential.
    \item \textbf{What is the spike non-linearity?}
    This property of SNNs makes it difficult to train them.
    \item \textbf{What are amplitude an duration (resp what is shape)?}
    For consectutive action potentials these properties tend to stay constant.
    \item \textbf{What is a calcium ion?}
    CamK2 is dependent on this tiny second messenger.
    It is used to justify
    \item \textbf{What is the reparametrization trick?}
    deltaWij = xiyj is commonly use to formalize the simplest form
    \item \textbf{What is the hebbian learning rule?}
    \item \textbf{What is the temporal difference rule?}
    \item \textbf{What is the triplet rule?}
    In this rule a presynaptic, event followed by ps ev
    \item \textbf{What is facilitation/post tetanic potentiation?}
    In short-term plasticity this gain may precede depletion.
